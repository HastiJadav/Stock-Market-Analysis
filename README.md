Stock Market Analysis and Visualization (Capstone Project)

📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing stock market trends for top Indian companies across five key sectors: Automobile, Banking, IT, Pharma, and FMCG. The goal is to help investors understand price movement, volatility, trading volume, and the impact of market events using clean data and interactive dashboards.

🧩 Technologies Used

SQL – For data extraction and querying

Python (EDA) – For data cleaning, formatting, and preprocessing

Power BI – For dashboard creation and data visualization

🧹 Data Cleaning & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Performed using Python:
